# Bundle-utils

![How it works](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1521229/34436061-ef845750-ec9a-11e7-9b66-d5e8d00d3d27.png)

### .browsers.json
This is an optional config to configure multiple bundles concept. Just pass all requirements using browserslist notation in array. For each item new bundle will be generated with specific id. Then you can serve it with any static server.

*.browsers.json*
```json
[
  "not dead",
  "last 5 chrome versions, last 5 safari versions, last 5 firefox versions",
  "last 1 chrome version, last 1 safari version, last 1 firefox version",
]
```


### Bundler side
Currently it supports webpack and parcel.

#### Webpack
Since webpack supports multiple configs with array type and creates new bundle for each one, we can just wrap our usual webpack config with `mapConfigToTargets` wrapper and pass here function which expects your webpack config to be returned, but also passes `browsers` and `id` arguments.
This 2 arguments implements the core idea of this package.

Wrap your config with `mapConfigToTargets` and pass `browsers` to babel-preset-env's `targets`. With id you can configure your bundle location. It will be synced with server-side part, so you can easily get it and serve in future.

With the help of `getBundleLocationWithId` we can better resolve bundle location for both server and bundler side.

*webpack.config.js*
```js
const path = require('path');
const { mapConfigToTargets, getBundleLocationWithId } = require('./utils/env-bundles');

module.exports = mapConfigToTargets(({ browsers, id }) => {
  return {
    entry: [path.join(__dirname, 'app/main.js')],
    output: {
      path: getBundleLocationWithId(`${__dirname}/dist/`, id), // generate your output location with specific bundle id.
      filename: '[name].js',
      publicPath: '/',
    },
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.js/,
          exclude: /node_modules/,
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          query: {
            presets: [
              [
                '@babel/preset-env',
                {
                  targets: browsers, // pass browsers as a targets for current bundle.
                },
              ],
            ],
          },
        }
      ],
    },
  };
});
```

#### Node.js
Here we just need to read configs and understand the sizes of bundles. So we could serve smallest bundle possble for every target. For example, chrome will receive the smallest bundle, but IE - possibly the biggest.

*server.js*
```js
const BUNDLE_DIRNAME = 'dist';
const bundlesRoot = path.join(__dirname, BUNDLE_DIRNAME);
const { getBundleIdByRequest } = initializeBundleGetter({ bundlesRoot });

app.use(express.static(`${__dirname}/dist`));
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  const bundleId = getBundleIdByRequest(req);
  const fullPath = path.join(__dirname, BUNDLE_DIRNAME, bundleId, req.url);
  res.write(fs.readFileSync(path.join(fullPath)));
  res.end();
});
```
